# HR Analytics Dashboard Project

## Overview

The **HR Analytics Dashboard Project** is an interactive data visualization tool built to help organizations gain actionable insights into their workforce. Using Tableau, the dashboard analyzes key HR metrics such as employee turnover, recruitment efficiency, workforce demographics, and performance trends. This project highlights my ability to transform raw data into meaningful solutions that support strategic decision-making and operational excellence.

The project is designed to empower HR teams with a clear understanding of workforce trends and to facilitate data-driven policies for recruitment, retention, and organizational growth.
